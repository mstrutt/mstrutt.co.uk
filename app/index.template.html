    <h2 class="heading heading--alpha">Welcome to my site</h2>
    <p class="intro p-summary">I'm a front-end developer at my core, I love getting stuck in and writing clean, accessible code or trying out the latest JavaScript library. My current role is as a Tech Community Lead at <a href="https://p.ota.to" class="p-org p-affiliation" rel="noreferrer">Potato</a> where focus is unlocking the potential of the tech community, making sure that I share my knowledge and experience on projects, and taking steps to inspire the next generation of Developer.</p>
    <p>As is the done thing, I've built this site up from scratch to help showcase my skills, picking and choosing the right technologies for the job. For the backend I've decided to write a simple Node.js server using express. I'm using the lightweight and super-fast <a href="https://squirrelly.js.org/" rel="noreferrer">Squirrelly</a> to handle templating, along with <a href="https://marked.js.org" rel="noreferrer">marked</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jxson/front-matter" rel="noreferrer">front-matter</a> so that I can organise my blog in markdown files. On the frontend, I preprocess my CSS with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" rel="noreferrer">Sass</a> and then and use <a href="https://parceljs.org/" rel="noreferrer">Parcel</a> to handle all of the asset bundling. For continuous integration I'm using <a href="https://codeship.com">Codeship</a>, which builds and deploys to a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=49bd26b41a79">Digital Ocean</a> VPS I manage.</p>
    <p>All the code is <a href="https://github.com/mstrutt/mstrutt.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">hosted on GitHub</a> so please feel free check it out. It will probably give a better representation of my skills than any content I could put on here.</p>

    <h2 class="heading heading--alpha">A Little History</h2>
    <p class="intro p-education">I graduated from <a href="http://lboro.ac.uk">Loughborough University</a> with a 2:1 in Computer Science - which included a year-long professional placement as a User Experience Developer with the Web Agency: <span class="p-ord p-affiliation">Snow Valley</span>.</p>
    <p class="p-experience">At the end of my placement I was offered a permanent position with the company (which had since been bought by MICROS).They also offered to sponsor me throughout my final year of university, and offered several months of contracting work to fit in around my studies.</p>
    <p class="p-experience">Upon returning as a Front-end Developer, I took on the responsibility of mentoring the new interns who were joining on their professional placements, and focused on honing my JavaScript skills, quickly becoming the go-to for any of the team's JavaScript needs. I stayed with the company for a further 2 years (in which time <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oracle-buys-micros-systems-062314.html">MICROS was acquired by Oracle</a>), until I decided it was time for a new challenge.</p>
    <p class="p-experience">In August 2015 I co-founded Big Wednesday IO with a few other talented individuals I had previously worked with. As is often the case with startups, we used up our initial funding building our MVP and were unable to secure aditional investment. It was a fun and incredibly educational 9 months that really put my skills to the test.</p>
    <p class="p-experience">Since April 2016 I've been a Developer at <a href="https://p.ota.to/">Potato London</a>, a year into which I was promoted to Senior Developer. At Potato, as well as delivering solutions for clients such as Google, I'm heavily involved in Internship and Work Experience schemes we run.</p>
