    <h2>Welcome to my site</h2>
    <p class="intro p-summary">I'm a front-end dev with passion for making high-performance websites; playing around with the latest and greatest JavaScript frameworks; and writing clean, re-usable code. Day-to-day you'll find me about Moorgate working for <a href="http://bigwednesday.io" class="p-org p-affiliation">Big Wednesday IO</a> as Co-founder and Product Engineer.</p>
    <p>As is the done thing, I've built this site up from scratch to help showcase my skills, picking and choosing the right technologies for the job. For the back-end I've used the static-site generator <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, preprocess my CSS with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">autoprefixer</a>, and using <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> to automate the builds. For continuous integration I'm using <a href="https://codeship.com">Codeship</a>, which builds and deploys to a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=49bd26b41a79">Digital Ocean</a> VPS I manage.</p>
    <p>All the code is <a href="https://github.com/mstrutt/mstrutt.co.uk">hosted on GitHub</a> so please feel free check it out, and see how I do what I do best. It will probably give a better representation of my skills than any content I could put on here.</p>

    <h2>A Little History</h2>
    <p class="intro p-education">I graduated from <a href="http://lboro.ac.uk">Loughborough University</a> with a 2:1 in Computer Science - which included a year-long professional placement as a User Experience Developer with the Web Agency: <span class="p-ord p-affiliation">Snow Valley</span>.</p>
    <p class="p-experience">At the end of my placement I was offered a permanent position with the company (which had since been bought by MICROS).They also offered to sponsor me throughout my final year of university, and offered several months of contracting work to fit in around my studies.</p>
    <p class="p-experience">Upon returning as a Front-end Developer, I took on the responsibility of mentoring the new interns who were joining on their professional placements, and focused on honing my JavaScript skills, quickly becoming the go-to for any of the team's JavaScript needs. I stayed with the company for a further 2 years (in which time MICROS being bought out by Oracle), until I decided it was time for a new challenge.</p>
    <p class="p-experience">In August 2015 I co-founded <a href="http://bigwednesday.io">Big Wednesday IO</a> with a few other talented individuals I had previously worked with.</p>
